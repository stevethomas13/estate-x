# Estate X - A Modern Real Estate Marketplace

Welcome to **Estate X**, a full-stack real estate marketplace application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This project is designed to help users buy, sell, and search for properties with advanced features such as authentication, property management, and a rich user experience. Estate X was inspired by the [Full-stack MERN Real Estate App](https://www.youtube.com/@reactproject) course and is a complete implementation of a modern real estate platform.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Estate X** offers users the ability to manage property listings, search for homes, and handle accounts securely with JWT-based authentication. This app demonstrates advanced CRUD operations and a smooth user interface built with React, Redux Toolkit, and modern web development practices.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Authentication**:
  - Secure user registration and login with **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).
  - **Google OAuth** integration for easy third-party login.
  
- **Property Management**:
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) property listings.
  - Upload and display property images.
  - Manage user-specific property listings.

- **Advanced Search**:
  - Search for properties based on filters such as location, price, and property type.

- **State Management**:
  - Redux Toolkit is used for efficient and scalable state management.

- **User-Friendly UI**:
  - Clean and responsive design for a seamless user experience.
  - Real-time property updates using Express.js and MongoDB.

- **Deployment**:
  - Deployed for free using **Render** platform.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- **Full-stack development** with the MERN stack.
- Implementing **secure authentication** using JWT and OAuth.
- Performing **CRUD operations** with MongoDB and handling **file uploads**.
- Using **Redux Toolkit** for state management in a large-scale React app.
- Deploying full-stack applications using platforms like **Render**.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

Some possible improvements that could be added in future updates:
